# Contacts Project

This repo was a code-along with the first project in the [React Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019) I took in 2018.

Most of the commits in this repository correspond to videos in the program. My coding contributions are under the branch `starter-files-added`. Please check it out.

## Project Setup

1.  Clone the Project - `https://github.com/joselimaneto/react-contacts-app.git`
2.  Go into the directory where the project now lives - `cd react-contacts-app`
3.  Checkout branch `starter-files-added` - `git checkout starter-files-added`
4.  Install the dependencies - `npm install`
5.  Start the app - `npm start`
6.  Clone the Contact Back-end Server Project - `git clone https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-contacts-server.git`
7.  Install server's dependencies - `npm install`
8.  Start the server - `node server.js`

## Contributing

Because this is a code-along project and the commits correspond to specific videos in the program, we will not be accepting pull requests.

If you feel like there's a major problem, please open an issue to discuss the problem and potential resolution.
